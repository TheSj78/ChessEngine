# ChessEngine

Made this because this one guy I didn't like (I actually despised him) said I couldn't beat him in chess.

He was right, I couldn't.

But...

*insert dramatic music*

I could code! So I coded up a bot that would allow me to beat him.

## how?

I hacked lichess.org ðŸ’€ðŸ’€

## huh?

No like seriously ðŸ’€. I looked at the website, looked at their html by inspecting element, and figured out what was changing each time someone made a move.

It was the FEN string, and that took me a LOT of time to figure out. But from there, it was easy sailing. I plugged the data into Stockfish, a chess engine, which returned the best possible move. This was fully on the terminal and I would not have to update any move I made: I'd just enter the link of the game and my color--and the code would automatically tell me the best possible move.

## other notes

I got banned LOL
Also they fixed the website. You're welcome lichess :))

I also beat the guy in case you were wondering. Big W for real
